## ConnectionMgr

### Take Complete Control of Your Network with ConnectionMgr

Meet Connection Manager, the powerful yet intuitive network-monitoring tool that puts you in command of every connection your machine makes. Instantly reveal all active TCP/UDP connections (both IPv4 and IPv6) in a clean, real-time dashboard designed for clarity, insight, and speed.

Whether you're a power user, developer, gamer, or security-minded professional, ConnectionMgr lets you take action the moment you see something suspicious. Block unwanted connections with a single click:

* Block by local port via automatic Windows Firewall rules
* Block by process to contain apps you don’t fully trust
* Block outbound hostnames using safe, reversible hosts-file rules

Connection Mgr isn’t meant to be a firewall replacement — it’s a smarter, more focused control panel that shows only the rules you created, giving you a streamlined view of what truly matters.

### But the real magic comes from built-in AI assistance:

Simply add your OpenAI-compatible API credentials 

[![settings][screenshot-settings]](/)

and unlock instant, intelligent insights about any connection: suspicious hosts, unknown processes, unusual traffic patterns, and more. Use the OpenAI API and talk directly to ChatGPT or even local running LLMs like f.e. Ollama or LM Studio, or any LLM that is OpenAI compatible! With AI at your side, even complex network activity becomes easy to understand.

### Fast. Powerful. Transparent.
ConnectionMgr turns your PC into a network you can finally see & control.

_Since ConnectionMgr can kill running processes, manipulate the Windows Firewall and the Windows Hosts file, admin privileges are needed in order to make shure the application performes as intended._
